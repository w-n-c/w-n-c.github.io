				<h2>Board Game Hunter</h2>
				<section class="project-description">
					<h3>Make hunting down your favourite out of print board game (less) painful</h3>
					<p>This is my current project. The project has a sometimes-used project page
            on github <a href="https://github.com/users/w-n-c/projects/1/views/4">here.</a>
					  Its written in Clojure/Clojurescript using the Luminus Framework. You can learn
            about the framework via the accompanying book "Web Development with Clojure", found
            <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3/web-development-with-clojure-third-edition/">
              here.

				<section class="project-status">
					<h3>Current Status</h3>
					<p>The search is functional for bgg's 'classic' market listings. Auctions are WIP
            and, although I love it, BGG has once again made my life difficult by adding a
            new market-to-replace-all-markets. So guess I'll be working on that as well.
          </p>
				</section>
				<section class="project-goals">
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Search all of bgg in one location</h4>
							<p>We were almost there until BGG added a new market. Further investigation is needed
              to see what is required from an api-access standpoint.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Aggregate search with notifications</h4>
							<p>One off searches are nice, but the ability to save a collection and get pinged
              via PWA notification on your phone would be even nicer</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Integration with other sites</h4>
							<p>BGG market hunts are great, but sometimes other board game sites like GameNerdz
              have fantastic deals on new or ding-and-dent copies of games, factor in their cheap
              or even free shipping and the used market all of the sudden does not look as great
              (from a price point perspective, environmentally still all about buying used).</p>

				<h2>Freelancer's Calendar</h2>
				<section class="project-description">
					<h3>The Google Calendar replacement you didn't know you needed (still w.i.p.)</h3>
					<p>This was my main pre-full-time project. Its written in React, and uses
					a Node.js backend connected to a MongoDB instance. There are no class
					components, and a lot of hooks. Code viewable
					<a href="https://github.com/w-n-c/freelancers-calendar">here</a>, the live
					site is hosted <a href="https://w-n-c.dev">here</a> and an embed
					of the site may be found below.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="project-status">
					<h3>Current Status</h3>
					<p>The site is functional! You log in through google, create and
					manage events, then view them in weekly or monthly views.</p>
					<aside class="note">NOTE: I have a side goal of making my own web components for input,
					so I just put in a placeholder form for editing events. It assumes
					24hr time and YYYY/MM/DD formatted dates.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section class="project-goals">
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Reach feature parity with the core of Google Calendar</h4>
							<p>Right now, that means allowing users to have multiple calendars,
							the ability to share events/calendars with each other and a few additional
							calendar views.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Add features unique to the Freelancer's Calendar</h4>
							<p>The most important feature enhancement is the ability to set flexible
							calendar items, and move them as a group. With these features, a meeting
							can run long without making you want to throw your whole calendar away
							for the rest of the day.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Integration with other calendars (iCal/gCal)</h4>
							<p>Event importing/exporting is a given, but I'd like the ability to
							keep the calendars in sync. Research into API's and license agreements
							is necessary before moving forward.</p>

				<h2>Soccer Team Site</h2>
				<section class="project-description">
					<h3>A for-fun project to play with a few React libraries</h3>
					<p>This site was made primarily to learn about styling and animation.
					It uses material-ui, and a couple React animation libraries alongside
					d3-ease to make some nice scroll and load animations.
					</p><p>It also has an admin section with a basic login system and
					forms to manage players and matches. This includes image file uploading.
					It uses Google Firebase for the backend.

				<h2>Nand2Tetris</h2>
				<section class="project-description">
					<h3>Taking the term 'full-stack' too far</h3>
					<p>This is probably my favorite project right now. The idea is to
					build a <em>heavily</em> simplified computer, write a language for it,
          then an operating system, and eventually a user app (tetris).</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Use HDL to specify hardware components for a computer</h4>
							In other words, start with just NAND gates and build up the logic
							for a simple computer with a register based	cpu and ram.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Write a linker for a simple assembly language targeting the
								aforemention hardware</h4>
							A description of the assembly language is given as a start point.
							My code for the linker was written in Java, and is shown in a
							gist embedded below.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Write a VM translator for a given IR to our assembly language</h4>
							The system language compiles to a VM. The first step is to map the
							VM language to the hardware's assembly language.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Write a compiler for a object-based language to the VM</h4>
							The language has basic typing and classes but no inheritance.
							A small standard library, including screen utilities is also
							written.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Write an Operating System in the new language</h4>
							This includes a runtime, as well as software abstractions for
							hardware (screen, keyboard) and better memory allocation utilities.
						</li>
