          <h2>Books of 2022</h2>
            <aside>
              I am sad to admit I have not been reading as much as I used to, but I am hoping to
              pick it up more this year! My reading list is growing too long and I do miss it.
              These are all either books I am currently reading or finished this year.

                <h3 class="title">Blood River Rising: The Thompson-Crismon feud of the 1920s</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Victoria Pope Hubbell</h4>
                <p>A book recommended to me by my mother- it tells the story of a family feud
                escalating to the point of murder brought about, largely, by the arrival of
                the KKK in a tiny, effectively all white farming town. It was of special
                interest to us because I grew up within a few miles of the events of the book.

                <h3 class="title">The Science of Accelerated Learning</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Peter Hollins</h4>
                <p>A quick read, and one with simple grounded rules for learning. I appreciate
                that it disproves the notion of 'types' of learners and focuses on what I would
                call (oversimplified) 'interaction' in learning. Whether by repeating out loud,
    or writing down/sorting/reviewing you must be actively engaged in order to
    retain information efficiently.</p>

                <h3 class="title">The Gulag Archipelago Volume 1</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</h4>
                <p>If you are unfamiliar with this work, you should rectify that immediately.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">Blackberries in the Dream House</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Diane Frank</h4>
                <p>"What would happen to us if we were to undertake the discipline of turning
                our life entirely and self-consciously into a poem? Through Yukiko, who becomes
                both a contemplative Buddhist and a geisha skilled in the refinements of
                sensuous pleasure, Diane Frank allows us to live within the soul of a young
                woman who has undertaken to create a life imagined and expressed as a poem, in
                every moment, waking and sleeping, making love or meditating." - Pierre DeLattre

                <h3 class="title">The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Isabel Wilkerson</h4>
                <p>A narrative exploration of the migration of ~6 million african-americans to
                  the north from 1915 to 1970. The fictional characters are spread in location
                  and time, and are strongly influenced by the actual histories of over 1000 people
                  interviewed for this book.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>
                <p>My only audio book, and one I have heard a lot of criticism on regarding 
                  authorial bias and broad, shallow strokes. I understand, and probably even
                  agree with most of that criticism, but I still find the work very engaging.
                  To expound: Even if you don't agree that wheat tricked man into indenturing
                  itself to long hours in the field- the notion itself is nonetheless fascinating.
                  <br />
                  (The example is admittedly perhaps too benign- the author continues through
                  slavery, capitalism, and colonialism and on ground that is already shaking.)</p>

                <h3 class="title">Iliad</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Homer</h4>
                <p>I have read very few 'classic novels' or 'great works'. I never had a literature class which
                  seems quite odd in retrospect (given my adoration of reading). Post-college I 
                  still avoided them because many, I felt, were quite impenetrable without guided
                  study and discourse. I still feel that way to an extent but my Homeric
                  translation is easy to read and my girlfriend's mother is a classics professor
                  so the many questions evoked by the text regarding greek culture and mindset
                  are quickly answered. Thank you professor!

                <h3 class="title">The Broken Earth Trilogy</h3>
                <h4 class="author">N. K. Jemisin</h4>
                <p>I cannot seem to describe this book without an egregious quantity of spoilers
                  so instead I'll say this- I started the first book and promptly dropped
                  everything else I was reading until I had finished the series.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Harlan Ellison</h4>
                <p>Stories of the future (and the now, and when, and everywhere) where
                  people are too much the same. Plus the true story of Santa Claus.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
                <h4 class="author">J.R.R. Tolkien</h4>
                <p>Its been over 20 years since I've read these books. Its astonishing to me that they are
                  as enjoyable now, if for completely different reasons, as they were back then.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">Amusing Ourselves to Death</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Neil Postman</h4>
                <p>How many episodes of Last Week Tonight have I watched without taking any real
                action after? This work left me feeling very troubled after reading, and that is
                definitely to be interpreted as praise.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">Caves of Steel</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Isaac Asimov</h4>
                <p>I could have sworn I wasn't interested in murder mystery novels...</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Anne Burrows; Walt Whitman</h4>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="title">The Song Of The Cell</h3>
                <h4 class="author">Siddhartha Mukherjee</h4>
                <p>Emergency purchased to get through a 3 hour flight delay and I'm so glad I found it.
                A narrative exploration of the discovery of and treatments designed for cells.

					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Board Gaming</h3>
							<p>This was a COVID hobby but now with a bookshelf overflowing with games and weekly
              meetups I think its safe to stay this is here to stay. If you are familiar with BGG,
              <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/nyxnaut">this is me</a>. If you are not
              familiar at all with modern boardgaming I would highly recommend it! Its a very
              different scene from the Sorry!, Monopoly and Risk I grew up with, and a nice
              way to have a screen free night in. Always happy to play so reach out!
              </p>
						</li>
            <li>
							<h3>Bouldering</h3>
							<p>I was introduced to climbing by a friend in college but I only
								started going full time after moving to New York. Its super hard
								and super fun! I climb at the Cliffs: Gowanus and am looking for
                a climbing partner so shoot me a message!</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Guitar</h3>
							<p>I am still <em>very</em> much a beginner, but I picked up my first
								electric guitar a few months ago and its been so much fun! Working
								through simple chord progressions, e.g. <em>Cosmic Dancer</em> by 
								T. Rex, but the secret dream is a Talking Heads cover band ha ha.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Coffee</h3>
							<p>A lot of people like coffee, but I am definitely a few deviations
							from the middle of that bell curve. I brew at home, and love to
							experiment with a lot of different devices: AeroPress, percolators, 
							fabric/metal/paper drips, moka pots, french-press, espresso, turkish
							... These days its mostly narrowed down to a Clever Dripper and my
							pride and joy, an Elektra MicroCasa.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Bonsai</h3>
							<p>My girlfriend very sweetly signed me up for a bonsai class. I now have a
							single pre-shaped 8 yr old juniper tree that I lovingly dote on.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Kintsugi</h3>
							<p>Kintsugi is a style of (primarily ceramic) repair that emphasizes rather than 
							hides the damage via bold metallic repair lines. We have a food & microwave safe
							kintsugi kit from Etsy that has repaired many a plate, mug, and gravy bowl.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Crochet</h3>
							<p>I was introduced to crochet when a friend gifted me a crochet kit for the
							holidays and now I have a seemingly endless number of baskets to make. I
              have not read Marie Kondo, but I feel connected by a need to put everything
              in a container of some form haha. It also helps avoid that itch to make my
              friends a bunch of crochet clothing they do not want. Its awful, someone
              please save them (me).
