            <h2>Books of 2022</h2>
            <aside>
              I am sad to admit I have not been reading as much as I used to, but I am hoping to
              pick it up more this year! My reading list is growing too long and I do miss it.
              These are all either books I am currently reading or finished this year.

                    <h3 class="title">Blood River Rising: The Thompson-Crismon feud of the 1920s</h3>
                    <h4 class="author">Victoria Pope Hubbell</h4>
                    <p>A book recommended to me by my mother- it tells the story of a family feud
                    escalating to the point of murder brought about, largely, by the arrival of
                    the KKK in a tiny, effectively all white farming town. It was of special
                    interest to us because I grew up within a few miles of the events of the book.

                    <h3 class="title">The Science of Accelerated Learning</h3>
                    <h4 class="author">Peter Hollins</h4>
                    <p>A quick read, and one with simple grounded rules for learning. I appreciate
                    that it disproves the notion of 'types' of learners and focuses on what I would
                    simplify as 'interation' in learning. Whether by repeating out loud, or writing
                    down/sorting/reviewing you must be actively engaged in order to retain
                    efficiently.</p>

                    <h4 class="author">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</h4>
                    <p>If you are unfamiliar with this work, you should rectify that immediately.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Blackberries in the Dream House</h3>
                    <h4 class="author">Diane Frank</h4>
                    <p>"What would happen to us if we were to undertake the discipline of turning
                    our life entirely and self-consciously into a poem? Through Yukiko, who becomes
                    both a contemplative Buddhist and a geisha skilled in the refinements of
                    sensuous pleasure, Diane Frank allows us to live within the soul of a young
                    woman who has undertaken to create a life imagined and expressed as a poem, in
                    every moment, waking and sleeping, making love or meditating." - Pierre DeLattre

					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Board Gaming</h3>
							<p>This was a COVID hobby but now with a bookshelf overflowing with games and weekly
              meetups I think its safe to stay this is here to stay. If you are familiar with BGG,
              <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/nyxnaut">this is me</a>. If you are not
              familiar at all with modern boardgaming I would highly recommend it! Its a very
              different scene from the Sorry!, Monopoly and Risk I grew up with, and a nice
              way to have a screen free night in. Always happy to play so reach out!
              </p>
						</li>
            <li>
							<h3>Bouldering</h3>
							<p>I was introduced to climbing by a friend in college but I only
								started going full time after moving to New York. Its super hard
								and super fun! I climb at the Cliffs: Gowanus and am looking for
                a climbing partner so shoot me a message!</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Guitar</h3>
							<p>I am still <em>very</em> much a beginner, but I picked up my first
								electric guitar a few months ago and its been so much fun! Working
								through simple chord progressions, e.g. <em>Cosmic Dancer</em> by 
								T. Rex, but the secret dream is a Talking Heads cover band ha ha.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Coffee</h3>
							<p>A lot of people like coffee, but I am definitely a few deviations
							from the middle of that bell curve. I brew at home, and love to
							experiment with a lot of different devices: AeroPress, percolators, 
							fabric/metal/paper drips, moka pots, french-press, espresso, turkish
							... These days its mostly narrowed down to a Clever Dripper and my
							pride and joy, an Elektra MicroCasa.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Crochet</h3>
							<p>I was introduced to crochet when a friend gifted me a crochet kit for the
							holidays and now I have a seemingly endless number of baskets to make. I
              have not read Marie Kondo, but I feel connected by a need to put everything
              in a container of some form haha. It also helps avoid that itch to make my
              friends a bunch of crochet clothing they do not want. Its awful, someone
              please save them (me).
